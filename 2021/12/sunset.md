Sunset is intended to be used by all demographic groups but is expected a greaterfocus on younger people as they are the ones who currently travel the most, in search ofadventures and new experiences, and those who are more open to the adoption of newtechnologies, such as blockchain. Is also between the younger layers of our society thatthe increasingly concerns about environment and climate changes appear to be stronger,as the new generations feel under pressure to take action towards the creation of aresilient future to our planet. This aligns with the Sunset’s mission regarding thepromotion of sustainable tourism and reward travelers that choose to have a positiveimpact to the environment and local communities. Additionally, as travelers have beenchanging their behavior, choosing destinations closer to home, Sunset will be workingwith a special focus on domestic tourism and growing the concept of staycation.The Sunset Vision is to be the first to create a fully functional DAO and becomethe leading platform in the travel market, disrupting the conventional business model ofonline travel agencies through innovation. By eliminating unnecessary middlemen, weintend to redirect travelers’ resources, such as time and money, to what is reallyimportant, the travel experience. Because we consider that only our planet should becentralized, we want to inspire travelers in creating a positive impact in the localcommunities and in the environment, and thus, to pursue a resilient future forgenerations to come.
