# Cure Cosplay ICO Due Diligence
Cure WorldCosplay is the worldâ€™s largest Cosplay platform, supporting 12 languages where more than 720,000 members from more than 180 countries post their quality works - 6.5 million images and counting. Our official social media accounts are followed by more than 430,000 people across Facebook, Twitter, and Weibo. We have a strong emphasis on providing community service which is characterized by self-sustainability and development. Cosplayers have various motivations for their activity, some Cosplayer want to become professional, others want more fans, and yet others are looking to share their work with groups. Photographers and Props Makers working closely with Cosplayers also have some influence on the increasing diversity of motivations.   COT will be used as a payment currency within the Cure WorldCosplay ecosystem, helping cosplayers without access to other online payment methods to be tipped for their services.  Using the Cure Protocol, players will also be able to create and distribute their own personalised coin. This unique feature will bring power back to cosplayers, enabling them to monetize themselves as these coins can be used to tip players as well as purchase merchandise or event tickets. Player Coins will provide an accessible platform for cosplayers to promote their identity to the continuously growing 720,000 member-base of Cure WorldCosplay, as they will be directly attainable by fans. These coins will also allow cosplayers to develop deeper relationships with their communities, as users will be able to explicitly show their support while also gamifying their experience.
