Our vision is to build a decentralized international investment fund that will unite the most influential blockchain organizations and allow them to connect with projects that require funding. Our investors receive a share of our fund and lifetime dividends, while we continue to hold and increase the value of the Lotus Capital Token. Lotus Capital works according to an enhanced buy-back mechanism: profits from our investments are used to buy back the Lotus Capital token, increasing the value for holders.
