# Plentix ICO Due Diligence
The advent of cryptocurrencies and the tokenized economy makes it possible to re-imagine the entire value chain of consumer, products, and producers from a referral perspective. We present Plentix, a tokenized platform that enables users to refer other users to a business entity and enables business entities to leverage existing APIs forindustry specific referrals and allows for safe, secure, trustless value exchange to take place. Unlike other referral platforms, Plentix unleashes the potential of a new global ecosystem to monetize referrals for every stakeholder, from the producer to the consumer.
