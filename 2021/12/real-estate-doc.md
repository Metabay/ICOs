# Real Estate Doc ICO Due Diligence
Real Estate Doc (RED) will revolutionise the managing of commercial real estate businesses. Running on our blockchain network, our technology platform facilitates secure, immutable and legally binding transactions between parties using blockchain and smart contracts in a seamless environment, to achieve data-driven, cost-efficient and seamlessly fast transactions. Our long term vision for RED is to become a versatile blockchain protocol and business application where real estate companies can rent out and transact the lease of any kind of commercial real estate space. Through the RED application, the user will easily manage every aspect of these transactions on one convenient application. The RED blockchain protocol will over time, also allow for other real estate businesses to plug-in to the RED private sidechain with their existing system to access its benefits available. RED has successfully deployed proof-of-concepts in large commercial retail establishments in Singapore, streamlining commercial retail leasing transactions between landlords and vendors.
