# Quantler ICO Due Diligence
Quantler is a blockchain for creating, analysing, sharing and running of decentralized structured investment products. Create structured products (such as an ETF) in equities or cryptocurrencies using themes. As there are a lot of the tokenized products being launched (currently over 1 900 available) the structured products for these assets are lacking behind (such as sector-based ETFs). Using Quantler’s blockchain anyone can create structured products (for regular assets such as Equities and cryptocurrencies) and run them on a decentralized network (much like smart contracts). Quantler also allows for regular assets, for this market Quantler’s solution is more flexible and has a lower costs base (targeted for exchanges, family offices and investment managers). The QUANT token’s intrinsic value is dependent on the AUM (asset under management) by the entire network. Quantler is like a Vanguard or BlackRock, but then in the form of a network.
