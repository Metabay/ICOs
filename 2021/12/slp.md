# SLP ICO Due Diligence
SLP is a decentralized platform for loyalty programs, with a blockchain based bonus point exchange, dedicated loyalty token wallets and a targeted marketing engine. As more consumers participate in brand loyalty programs, more loyalty points are going unclaimed — a recent survey by Bond Brand Loyalty records $100 billion in unused points. The abandonment trend - where members decide a loyalty program isn’t worth their time - is increasing. Regardless of which type of loyalty program model businesses use, consumers are more demanding than ever. Weak connection with customers can result in losing those who join but fail to participate and customer attrition where customers perception of program value has declined over time. SLP will implement an infrastructure through which businesses can issue, process and use tokenized loyalty points on a distributed blockchain platform. This will enable customers to exchange bonus points using the platform's primary currency, SLP tokens, and spend earned bonus points on rewards and products that matter to them personally. The result: brand loyalty experiences that are more efficient, interactive and engaging.
