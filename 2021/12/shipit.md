# Shipit ICO Due Diligence
Shipit â€” is a community of senders and travelers united by the mobile app that helps the former ship packages and the latter make extra money while traveling. Shipit is a symbiosis of best ideas and practices of courier, crowdsource and crowdshipping services. We have synthesized the best business practices to create a revolutionary and unique service. Just as Uber and BlaBlaCar have already become a part of our daily lives, Shipit is going to become an irreplaceable tool for shipping. It is the first app of its kind that will use smart contracts and blockchain as a native tool to make people lives easier all around the world. By implementing Shipit tokens and using the blockchain we want to build relationships between users based on transparency, safety and ease of tracking for all deliveries on the platform. While courier services are becoming more expensive, Shipit allows users to ship and track open packages at lower costs and risks. Shipping has never been easier.
