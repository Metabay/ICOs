# MaxData ICO Due Diligence
MaxData is the first reverse bidding marketplace where service providers find consumers using blockchain technology. Using the MaxData platform, consumers anonymously provide information regarding the services they are looking for, allowing service providers to see exactly what offers consumers will be interested in. Service providers can then craft a tailor-made offer to send consumers, while saving time and money on their acquisition efforts.
